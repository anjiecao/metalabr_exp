## Datasets 

Datasets were retrieved from Metalab. As of February 2024, Metalab hosted 32 datasets in total, with research areas ranging from language learning to cognitive development. Each dataset synthesized the literature in one research area, with the scope of the dataset determined by the original contributor of the dataset. All datasets included effect size estimates converted to Cohen’s *d*, as well as estimates of effect size variance and a variety of other moderators (e.g., average age of participants) provided by the contributors. There were 2 desiderata for the datasets to be included in the final analysis: 

1. The dataset must describe an experimental (non-correlational) effect that uses behavioral measures, and 
2. For a dataset that has already been published, the aggregated meta-analytic effect reported in the published form must not be null (i.e., must be significantly different than zero). 

Five datasets did not meet the first desideratum (*Pointing and vocabulary (concurrent)*; *Pointing and vocabulary (longitudinal)*; *Video deficit*; *Symbolic play*; *Word segmentation (neuro)*), and one dataset did not meet the second desideratum (*Phonotactic learning*). These datasets were not included in the analysis. 

For the remaining 26 datasets, we made the following modifications to make their respective scope comparable such that each dataset corresponded to testing one distinct phenomenon. Following the organization in the original meta-analysis [@gasparini2021quantifying], we separated the *Language discrimination and preference* dataset into two datasets, one for discrimination and one for preference. We combined two pairs of datasets because they were testing the same experimental effects: *Gaze following (live)* and *Gaze following (video)* were combined into *Gaze following (combined)*; *Function word segmentation* and *Word segmentation (behavioral)* were combined into *Word segmentation (combined)*. We also replaced the *Infant directed speech preference* dataset with a more up-to-date version reported in @zettersten2024evidence. Finally, for phenomenon that was predicted to follow a negative developmental trend (i.e. *Vowel discrimination (non-native*), we flipped the sign of the effect sizes to make the effects comparable with the rest of the phenomena.

Our goal is to estimate the functional form of the developmental change in all of these meta-analytic datasets. To achieve this goal, we ran models with the same random effect structure specifications across all datasets. The random effect structure accounted for the both experiment-level grouping and the paper-level grouping. Not all datasets included these grouping variables so we recoded the missing ones to make sure the same random effect structure specifications could be applied to all datasets. 

```{r}
younger_than_36_df <- d %>% mutate(
 younger_than_36 = (mean_age_months <= 36) 
) %>% 
  group_by(younger_than_36) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n / nrow(d))

propotion_younger <- round((filter(younger_than_36_df, younger_than_36 == TRUE) %>% 
pull(proportion)) * 100,2)

```

Since we were mostly interested in the age trajectory of these constructs in early childhood, we further trimmed the datasets to include only effect sizes from participants under 36 months of age. This decision did not qualitatively affect our findings as most datasets did not include data above age 36 months (`r propotion_younger`% of the effect sizes are from participants who were younger than 36 months of age). The final analysis included 25 datasets in total, each covers a different developmental time window. Table 1 presents the names of all the datasets, along with the number of effect sizes and participants included for each dataset. 

## Methods

All of the statistical analyses were conducted in R. Meta-analytic models were fit using the `metafor` package [@viechtbauer2010conducting]. This was an exploratory study in which no hypotheses were pre-registered. All of the analysis scripts and data are available at [LINK](https://github.com/anjiecao/metalabr_exp).

For each dataset, we considered four functional forms as possible candidates for the shape of the developmental trajectory: linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and constant. A linear form is the most common assumption in the literature, whereas logarithmic and quadratic were chosen to represent sublinear growth and superlinear growth, respectively. The constant form served as a baseline for the other alternative growth patterns. Although other, more complex growth patterns are of course possible, we opted to compare these forms as a first pass. Note that the constant model includes one parameter (an intercept), linear and logarithmic models include two parameters (an intercept and a slope), and the quadratic model includes three parameters (intercept, slope, and quadratic growth term). 

For all analyses, we fit multilevel random-effects meta-regression models using nested random intercepts to account for both the testing of the same infants in multiple conditions (e.g., in a between-participants design) and multiple studies within a single paper. Meta-regression models predicted effect sizes (Cohen’s d) with mean age in months in different functional forms. We fit four meta-regression models in total for each dataset. These four models collectively test the positive change assumption and the linearity assumption. If the positive change assumption is true, we should expect the other three models all outperform the constant model. If the linearity assumption is true, the linear model would become the best fitting model for the dataset. 

## Results




```{r}
delta_aic_df <- readRDS(here("cached_data/delta_aic_df.Rds"))
total_n <- nrow(delta_aic_df)
n_has_any_meaningful_difference <- delta_aic_df %>% 
  filter(if_any(where(is.numeric), ~ .x > 4)) %>% 
  nrow()
n_has_no_differnece <- total_n - n_has_any_meaningful_difference
```

### Model comparison 

Our initial goal was to compare the fit of models with different functional forms for each meta-analysis. Because models differed in their complexity (number of parameters), we extracted the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) for each model. AIC measures the quality of the model fits while penalizing models with more parameters. It is calculated as the difference between two times the number of estimated parameters in the model and two times the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model. The corrected AIC further adjusts for the number observations, which is particularly suitable when the sample size is small relative to the parameters in the model. The model with the lowest AICc was considered the best fitting model, and all the remaining models were compared against it. The remaining model each received a $\Delta_{AIC}$, which was the difference between the AIC of the model and the AIC of the best fitting model. Following statistical convention, we treated $\Delta_{AIC} > 4$ as the statistical significance threshold [@burnham2004multimodel]. A best fitting model was significantly better than an alternative model if and only if the alternative model had  $\Delta_{AIC} > 4$. Note that in the situation of a completely constant pattern of effects across age, the maximal difference in model fit would be an AICc of exactly 4 between the constant and quadratic model, because the former has one parameter and the latter has three parameters. 

Figure 1 shows the prediction of each functional form. We found that the four functional forms could not be meaningfully distinguished in `r n_has_no_differnece` out of `r total_n` datasets. This situation typically arises because the data are constant and hence more complex models with zero parameters fit the data equally well. The remaining `r n_has_any_meaningful_difference` datasets yielded meaningful contrasts between different functional forms, but the linear form was not the best-fitting form for any dataset. Table 2 shows the model comparison results for each dataset.

One limitation of the model comparison approach is that it does not quantify growth over time. To further examine the positive increase assumption, we estimated linear meta-regression models and examined the estimates on the age predictor. We found that the slope estimate for age was not significantly different from zero the in majority of the datasets (16/25; Figure 2). 

## Discussion 

We conducted model comparisons to assess the functional forms of age-related change across 25 datasets. Four functional forms—linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and constant—were largely indistinguishable within most datasets. Notably, in the 6 datasets where evidence for a better fit of growth models compared to the constant model were found, linear models received no support, challenging the prevalent linearity assumption for early linguistic and cognitive development. 


Further, in direct statistical assessment of positive increases over age using regression models, we only detected evidence for linear growth in 9/25 meta-analyses. Past work has successfully revealed age-related changes using meta-analysis [e.g. @best2015age; @sugden2017meta; @mccartney1990growing]. But in most datasets that we have considered, effect size does not increase with age, despite theoretical reason to assume such a developmental change over age in the phenomena considered. Why?
